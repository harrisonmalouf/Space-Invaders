### Purpose

Space invaders was one of the very first games I remember playing as a young lad, this and how iconic the game is I felt the need to make it. This was a project made during my time at General Assembly. During the time of making this project it was an objective of mine to get a better fundamental understanding of javascript with the aid of the p5 library.

### Experience

During the time I'd been warned about the mathematical orientation around making videogames, especially around hitboxes. I guess that one person’s treasure is another person’s misery, it was definitely not easy but at certain points during this project I’d successfully constructed a program that recognised hit collision with the players shit and the invaders! Unfortunately, in its current state due to some changes I’ve mistakenly broken the code. In the coming future I intend to tread on carefully whilst adjust working code.

### Future

- sound effects for weapons, invaders, ship being damaged, music and more.

- updating the sprite for the bullets.

- implementing a score system.

### Special thanks

- **Joel Turnbull; Teacher**, It goes without saying he's an incredible teacher who's quick to understand what I'm asking so that I don't have to spend hours slaving over the internet to figure out why my code is bugged.

- **Rashida Bengali; Teacher Assistant**, At most stages through this project when I wasn't understanding a concept or a bug she was my go to for help. Her patience and dedication to helping me learn and create this project was paramount to my success.

- **Bonny Mentos; Mentor**, He was extremely helpful in guiding me through tackling each day with specific objectives. At the time I felt overwhelmed with questions like where to start, how to manage my time and so forth. Without his help I might of chosen a different project all together as it was a big task for me to tackle as an individual who's new to the coding industry. 

### Bugs

- Fix the shoot mechanic for the ship

- Hit recognition for ship and invaders fixed
